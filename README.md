# Percussion Ensemble DB - React Front End

This is the front end for a full stack application that compiles percussion ensemble data from a few different sources. The purpose is for ensemble directors to have one place to go to listen to and pick out percussion ensembles they want to play, and then be able to navigate to the publisher's website for purchase.

There are 3 parts to the application:

- [The front end](https://github.com/sds0208/perc-ens-frontend) (this repo) - built with React. 
- [The back end](https://github.com/sds0208/perc-ens-backend) - built with Node.js and Express.js. 
- [The scrapers](https://github.com/sds0208/perc-ens-scraper) - built with Python. Data sent to Neon database.

As of the end of June 2024, this is only an MVP, but feel free to check it out and see how it's going!
